# Build Tasks – ChainCal

> **Tip:** Tasks are ordered for a 3‑day hack sprint. Check items off as they are completed.

## Day 0 (Prep – 0.5 day)

- [x] **Create Repo & CI** – GitHub + branch protection, ESLint, Prettier.
- [x] **Scaffold Monorepo** – PNPM workspaces: `apps/web`, `packages/core`, `services/listener`.
- [x] **Database Provisioning** – Spin up Postgres + Redis (Supabase/Fly.io).

---

## Day 1 – Core Data Pipeline

- [x] **Define Event Schema**
  - [x] `contract_address`
  - [x] `event_signature`
  - [x] `event_args` (indexed JSON)
  - [x] `next_timestamp`
- [x] **Implement Alchemy Webhook Listener**
  - [x] Create webhook via API
  - [x] Express endpoint parses payload → writes to `events` table
  - [x] HMAC signature validation for security
- [ ] **Back-Fill Utility (Optional)** – CLI that scans past logs to populate initial `next_timestamp`s.
- [x] **Complete REST API**
  - [x] `GET /events/upcoming` and `POST /events`
  - [x] `GET /events` with pagination
  - [x] `PATCH /events/:id/snooze` for reminder management
