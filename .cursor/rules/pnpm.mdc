This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager and is structured as a monorepo with workspaces.

- **Package Manager:** Always use `pnpm` for installing, removing, and managing dependencies. Do not use `npm` or `yarn`.
- **Workspaces:** The project is divided into the following workspaces:
    - `apps/web`: The SvelteKit frontend application.
    - `packages/core`: Shared types, utilities, and core logic.
    - `services/listener`: The backend service for the Alchemy webhook listener.
- **Installing Dependencies:**
    - To add a dependency to a specific workspace, use the `--filter` flag: `pnpm --filter <workspace-name> add <package-name>`
    - For example, to add a package to the web app: `pnpm --filter web add <package-name>`
    - To add a dev dependency, use the `-D` flag.
- **Running Scripts:** Run scripts within workspaces using `pnpm --filter <workspace-name> <script-name>`.
