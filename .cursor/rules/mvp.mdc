The 3-day hackathon timeline requires a strict focus on the MVP. Features outside this scope should be considered stretch goals and deferred until after the initial build is complete.

**Core MVP Features (In Scope):**

1.  **Event Subscription:**
    - Manual entry of contract address and event signature.
    - A small, curated list of preset contracts for easy onboarding.
2.  **Core Data Pipeline:**
    - The full flow: Alchemy Webhook -> Listener Service -> PostgreSQL. This is the #1 priority.
3.  **Farcaster Frame:**
    - A Frame that lists upcoming events.
    - A "snooze" action button on the Frame.
4.  **Notifications:**
    - Email notifications via Alchemy Notify or a similar service.
5.  **Web Dashboard:**
    - A simple list view of upcoming events.
    - A modal to add new events.
6.  **iCal Export:**
    - A dynamic `.ics` feed endpoint.

**Stretch Goals (Out of Scope for MVP):**

- Publicly shareable calendar links.
- Advanced snooze logic (e.g., custom snooze times).
- Direct OAuth integration with Google/Outlook calendars.
- Cross-chain support beyond Ethereum mainnet and major L2s.
- Enterprise features or admin dashboards.
- Mobile push notifications.
